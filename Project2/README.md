### Project 3 Plan

(Please see [wiki](https://github.com/git-ankit/MovieRecommender/wiki/Project-3-Plan) for detailed information.)

Testing how good the Movie Recommender is :

1. Pick 10-15 very famous movies.
2. Make sure the movies have diversity based on genre, cast and production style.
3. Show users a set of 10 randomly generated movies vs top 10 movies recommended by the Movie Recommender.
4. Also ask the user how satisfied is he/she with the recommended movies.
4. Collect your results and quantify them.

Note: Our system can be virtually uploaded to sites like [Code SandBox](https://codesandbox.io/), for easier testing.

Make sure you taste your own medicine first and take into account other peoples familiarity with the system before you design your tests.
